Never, O never!
1687.
But divine melodious truth;
Tuwhoo!
And pledging with contented smack
And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
Unworthily admires.
How much to them I owe,
Like metals in a mine;
Birdie, say truly?"
And Greta woods are green;
That life brings with her in her equipage;
The World's a bubble, and the Life of Man
If these delights thy mind may move,
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore
Where'er she lie,
Unworthily admires.
His numbers languishing.
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
Archangel! Power of desolation!
May read how soon things have
My Love!
As each had been a bride;
Knell for the onset!
Of intermingling hues;
Parted for ever?
That I might there present it—O! to Whom?
Wi' murd'ring pattle!
My Mary!
Her cheeks are like the blushing cloud
Which he more harmless found than man, and mild.
I'll dight me in array;


My Mary!
And the whispering sound of the cool colonnade;
Thou art to me a stream of sorrow;
Is beautiful and free:
Tuwhoo!
Are worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.
That to the faithful herdman's art belongs!
Lycidas
'Cause her fortune seems too high,
The idle spear and shield were high up hung;
Forget not yet!

Peril and toil:
1687.
For Jock o' Hazeldean.
Chorus.
Beneath so beautiful a sun,
That on the green turf suck the honey'd showers
September, 1814.
Your breasts, where Cupid tumbling lies,
Shallow brooks, and rivers wide;
Some summer morning—
Down, as upon a bed.
And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould;
O Man! that from thy fair and shining youth
Buried in dust, once dead by fate.
Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the friend
Under the fountains
Rain-awaken'd flowers,

No, not thee!
Lycidas
This sweet May morning,
Star-inwrought!
Of islands, that together lie
And that her reign had here its last fulfilling;
THE EPITAPH.
The noble dame on turret high,
Since Ferdinand and you begun
And grinning Infamy.
And with his dancing crest
Draws many a tear frae true love's e'e
Your mind is light, soon lost for new love.
"And just above yon slope of corn
Save that, to die, I leave my Love alone.
In consecrated earth
No enemy
Never, O never!
Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound?
O Love! who bewailest
With much resemblance of the past

To fond imagination
Tuwhoo!
Ensaffroning sea and air
Star-inwrought!
Or sweetest Shakspeare, Fancy's child,
Waves in the eye of Heaven her many-colour'd wings.
No enemy
That fills my heart with sadness!
With twice four hundred men.
Never, O never!
There's nane again sae bonnie.
Her spectres wan, and birds of boding cry
Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song.
To gaze, how fondly! on thy face,
—Such were the sounds that o'er the crested pride
A solitary tear:
Reply, reply.
—"The gray-headed sexton
Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew
Returns each whisper spoken,
His wrath was changed to wailing.
Our after-fate,
All things in that sweet abode
With splendid feathers drest;
ODE TO DUTY
And grinning Infamy.
That I shall never look upon thee more,
And sounding lyre
Affection's ground
But might I of Jove's nectar sup,
And call the vales, and bid them hither cast
A home in every glade!


Whate'er delight
No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,
Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.
Or let me die!
Star-inwrought!
But lately, one rough day, this flower I past,
And, to the church-yard come, stopp'd short
1687.
Where the earth and ocean meet,
One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
Fancy, high-commission'd:—send her!
Whose want too well now feels my friendless case;
Thy nest which thou canst drop into at will,
Of intermingling hues;
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
Are belovéd of their dams;
1803.


And center'd in my breast.
(If cruel stars have not my ruin sworn
of air


Worn as if thy cold pavement were a sod,
And all thy threads with magic art

Spirit of Night!
Star-inwrought!
To a merry measure;—
LYCIDAS
And deny himself for Jove,
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
O punishment!
In vacant or in pensive mood,
To breathe some soften'd strain
Its aerial hue
Virtue, his darling child, design'd,
From the hard season gaining? Time will run
As this old worn-out stuff, which is threadbare to-day
Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young:
That to me gave this life's first native source,
Past all dishonour,
We die
Houseless by night.
The path that leads them to the grove,
Of thy meek nature!
The sods with our bayonets turning;
Rain-awaken'd flowers,
All things in that sweet abode
She stood, with amazement,
Drumossie moor—Drumossie day—
Wi' bickering brattle!
Thy looks are wan, thine eyes are wet.
Acorns ripe down-pattering
With meditation.
All the buds and bells of May,
Sweet Thames! run softly, till I end my song.
The dew of the morning


Cold inhumanity,
Thou art to me but as a wave
The proud are taught to taste of pain,
In she plunged boldly,
1687.
Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed."
And be ye call'd, my absent kisses.
Away
And I absolve thy future care;
Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.
Hail, divinest Melancholy!
